PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on
the Torch library,[1][2][3] used for applications such as
computer vision and natural language processing.[4] It is
primarily developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence
research group.[5][6][7] It is free and open-source software
released under the Modified BSD license. Although the
Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of
development,
PyTorch also has a C++ frontend.[8] Furthermore, Uber's
Pyro probabilistic programming language software uses
PyTorch as a backend.[9]
PyTorch provides two high-level features:[10]
• Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via
graphics processing units (GPU)
• Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
